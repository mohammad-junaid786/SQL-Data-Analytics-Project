Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - Measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.
    - Benchmark against average sales and track yearly trends.
    - Identify high-performing or underperforming entities.

Tables Used:
    - gold.fact_sales
    - gold.dim_products

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.
    - Aggregate Functions: SUM()

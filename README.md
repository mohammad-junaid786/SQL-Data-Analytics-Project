# SQL Data Analytics Project

## üìå Overview
This project showcases a complete **Data Analytics workflow** implemented purely in SQL.  
It follows two main phases:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì understanding the data and extracting key insights.
2. **Advanced Analytics** ‚Äì deeper, more sophisticated analyses for performance monitoring and decision-making.

The project is structured so that **each analysis type has its own SQL script**, making it easy to follow, reproduce, and extend.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
These scripts focus on understanding the structure, coverage, and basic trends in the dataset.

| #  | Module | Description | Script |
|----|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Database Exploration** | List tables, inspect schemas, row counts. | [`01_database_exploration.sql`](Scripts/01_database_exploration.sql) |
| 2 | **Dimensions Exploration** | Explore dimension tables for unique values. | [`02_dimensions_exploration.sql`](Scripts/02_dimensions_exploration.sql) |
| 3 | **Date Exploration** | Work with date fields: range, gaps, patterns. | [`03_date_exploration.sql`](Scripts/03_date_range_exploration.sql) |
| 4 | **Measures Exploration** | Summary stats for key numeric metrics. | [`04_measures_exploration.sql`](Scripts/04_measures_exploration.sql) |
| 5 | **Magnitude** | Identify largest/smallest metric values. | [`05_magnitude.sql`](Scripts/05_magnitude_analysis.sql) |
| 6 | **Ranking** | Rank entities (Top N / Bottom N). | [`06_ranking.sql`](Scripts/06_ranking_analysis.sql) |

| 9 | **Performance Analysis** | Compare performance against benchmarks. | [`09_performance_analysis.sql`](Scripts/09_performance_analysis.sql) |
| 10 | **Part-to-Whole** | Proportional contribution analysis. | [`10_part_to_whole.sql`](Scripts/10_data_segmentation.sql) |
| 11 | **Data Segmentation** | Break down data by meaningful groups. | [`11_data_segmentation.sql`](Scripts/11_part_to_whole_analysis.sql) |
| 12 | **Customer Data Reporting** | Final Customer Data aggregated outputs for BI dashboards. | [`12_report_customers.sql`](Scripts/12_report_customers.sql) |
